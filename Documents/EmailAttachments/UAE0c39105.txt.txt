<P>by four right small little horses, with dark matted coats and bright, wilful eyes. a few hounds of choice<br>breed ran behind it. from within the hangings came a sharp, shrill screaming as were of many gaudy<br>parrots. in front of this waggon two men rode, unlike in stature and mien, and a loutish fellow led the<br>horses. now, we all knew this wain right well. heretofore, in the life time of old lorenz waldstromer, the<br>father of my uncle conrad, it had been wont to come hither once or  twice a year, and was ever made<br>welcome; if it should happen to come in the month of august it was at that season filled with noble<br>falcons, to be placed on board ships at venice, inasmuch as the sultan of egypt and his emirs were so<br>fain to buy them that they would give as much as a hundred and fifty sequins for he finest and best.<br>old jordan kubbeling of brunswick, the father of he man who had now come hither, was wont to send<br>the birds to alexandria by the hand of dealers, to sell them for him there; but his son seyfried, who<br>was to this day called young kubbeling, albeit he was nigh on sixty, would carry his feathered wares<br>thither himself. verily he was not suffered to sell any other goods in the land, inasmuch as the republic<br>set strait bounds to the dealings of german traders. if such an one would have aught from the levent<br>he may get it only through the merchants hall or fondaco in venice; and much less is a german<br>suffered to carry his wares, of what kind soever, out of venice into the east, inasmuch as every german<br>trader is bound to sell by the hand of the syndicate all which his native land can produce or make in<br>venice itself and in no other wise may a german traffic in any matters, great or small, with the venice<br>traders; and all this is done that the republic may lose nought of the great taxes they set on all<br>things. as to seyfried kubbeling, the great council, by special grace, and considering that none but he<br>was certainly no mere draught. it was exactly like a human sigh, only it was cold instead of warm. if<br>it proceeded from the ghost of the dead gladiator he must be quite close to him, and the fancy gained<br>reality in his mind; he saw a floating human form which beckoned him and softly laid a cold hand on<br>his shoulder. he, caesar, had linked his fate to that of the gladiator, and now tarautas had come to<br>warn him, but caracalla had no mind to follow him; he forbade the apparition with a loud cry of away<br>at this the indian started, and though he could scarcely utter the words, he besought caesar to be<br>seated that he might take off his laced shoes; and then caracalla perceived that it was an illusion that<br>had terrified him, and he shrugged his shoulders, somewhat ashamed. while the slave was busy he<br>wiped his damp brow, saying to himself with a proud smile that of spirits never appeared in<br>broad light and when others were present. at last he dismissed the indian and lay down. his head was<br>burning, and his heart beat too violently for sleep. at his bidding epagathos and adventus followed the<br>indian into the adjoining room after extinguishing the lamp caracalla was alone in the dark. awaiting<br>sleep, he stretched himself at full length, but he remained as wide awake as by day, and still he could<br>not help thinking of the immediate past. even his enemies could not deny that it was his duty as a<br>man and an emperor to inflict the severest punishment on this town, and to make it feel his avenging<br>hand; and yet he was beginning to be aware of the ruthlessness of his commands. he would have been<br>glad to talk it all over with some one else. but philostratus, the only man who understood him, was<br>out of reach; he had sent him to his mother, and for what purpose to tell her that he, caesar, had<br>found a wife after his own heart, and to win her favor and consent. at this thought the blood surged<br>up in him with rage and shame. even before they were wed his chosen bride had been false to him; she<br>presently i could see that he shook his big head though in doubt, nay, or in sorrow. i shuddered<br>again, and meseemed the grey clouds in the sky waxed blacker, while deathly pale airy forms floated<br>through the mist over the pools, in long, waving winding sheets. the thick black heads of the bubrushes<br>stood up motionless like grave stones, and the grey silken tufts of the bog grass, fluttering in the cold<br>breath of a november morning, were as ghostly hands, threatening or warning me. ere long i was to<br>forget the crows, and the fogs, and the reed grass, and all the foolish fears that possessed me, by<br>reason of a real and well founded terror; again did kubbeling shake his head, and then i heard him<br>call to my uncle conrad and grubner the headforester, to come close to him, but to tread carefully.
