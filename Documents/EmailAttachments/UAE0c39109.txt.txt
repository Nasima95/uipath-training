<P>disturbed his peace of mind when biberli suggested it. but when eva looked joyously up at him with the<br>credulous confidence of a trusting child, he could imagine no greater bliss than to hear his mother,<br>clasping the lovely creature in her arms, call her her dear little daughter. his reckless nature was<br>subdued, and an emotion of tenderness which he had never experienced before thrilled him as she<br>whispered, take me to a place where everybody can see us, but where we need not notice anyone else.<br>how significant was that little word we it showed that already she united herself and him in her<br>thoughts. to her pure nature nothing could be acceptable which must be concealed from the light of the<br>sun and the eyes of man. and her wish could be fulfilled. the place where biberli had discovered them,<br>and where refreshments had just been served to the emperor and the ladies and gentlemen nearest to his<br>person, who had been joined by several princes of the church, was shut off by the bannerets, thus<br>preventing the entrance of any uninvited person; but heinz schorlin belonged to the sovereigns and<br>had admittance everywhere. so he led eva behind the black and yellow rope to two vacant chairs at the<br>end of the enclosed space where the banquet had been swiftly arranged for the emperor and the otherbr>illustrious guests of nuremberg, these seats were in view of the whole company, yet it would have been<br>as difficult to interrupt him and his lady as any of the table companions of the imperial pair. eva<br>followed the knight without anxiety, and took her place beside him in the well chosen seat. a young<br>cup bearer of noble birth, with whom heinz was well acquainted, brought unasked to him and his<br>companion sparkling malvoisie in venetian glasses, and heinz began the conversation by inviting eva to<br>drink to the many days brightened by her favour which, if the saints heard his prayer, should follow<br>my fathers will, and again that proud smile came upon ulman pernharts bearded lips, and his eye<br>flashed fire as he said: my life moves in a narrow round, but all that dwell therein bend to my will as<br>the copper bends under hammer. if you think that the junker gave in without a struggle you are<br>greatly mistaken; after i had forbidden him the house, he had tempted gertrude to turn against me and<br>was ready to carry her off; nay, and would you believe it, my own mother sided with the young ones.<br>the priest even was in readiness to marry them privily, and they would have won the day in spite of<br>me. but the eyes of jealousy are ever the sharpest; my head apprentice, who was madly in love with the<br>maid, betrayed the plot, and then, mistress margery, were things said and done things concerning<br>which i had best hold my peace, and if you crave to know them, you may ask my mother. you will see<br>some day, if you do not scorn to enter my house and if you gain her friendship and i doubt not that<br>you will, albeit it is not granted to every one she will be glad enough to complain of my dealings in<br>this matter mine, her own sons, although on other points she is wont to praise my virtues over loudly.<br>this discourse raised my cousin once more to his old place in my opinion, and i knew now that the<br>honest glance of his blue eyes, which doubtless had won fair gertrudes heart, was trustworthy and true.<br>master ulman pernhart was married in a right sober fashion to fair mistress giovanna, and i remember<br>to this day seeing them wed in saint laurences church. it was a few months before this that i was taken<br>for the first time to a dance at the town hall. there, as soon as i had forgotten my first little fears, i<br>took my pleasure right gladly to the sound of the music, and i verily delighted in the dance. but albeit<br>i found no lack of young ladies my friends, and still less of youths who would fain win my favor, i<br>nevertheless lost not the feeling that i had left part of my very being at home; nay, that i scarce had a<br>right to these joys, since my brothers were in a distant land and ann could not share them with me<br>things, now fear of the majesty of the powerful sovereign made her breath come quicker. how, clinging<br>to her godfathers hand, she reached the emperor rudolphs throne she could never describe, for what<br>happened afterwards resembled a confused dream of mingled bliss and pain, from which shw was first<br>awakened by her fathers warning that the time of departure had come. when she raised her downcast<br>eyes the monarch was standing before the throne placed for him, she had been compelled to bend her<br>head backward in order to see his face, for his figure, seven feet in height, towered like a statue of<br>roland above all who surrounded him. but when, after the austrian duchess, his daughter in law, who</P></BODY><END>
