<P>whispered to me: how piously glad was your hymn, my sweetheart and you were right yestereve, and<br>peace shall indeed reign on earth, and above all betwixt you and me, everywhere and at all times till<br>the e n d .. a postscriptum by kunz schopper the children entreat me to write more of margerys<br>unfinished tale. howbeit i am nigh upon eighty years of age, and how may i hope to win favor in the<br>exercise of an act to which i am unskilled save in matters of business yet, whereas i could never endure<br>to say nay to any reasonable prayer of those who are dearest to my heart, i will fulfil their desire,<br>only setting down that which is needful, and in the plainest words. they at whose bidding i sit here, all<br>knew my dear sister well. margery, the widow of the late departed forest ranger, the knight sir gotz<br>waldstromer, councillor to his imperial majesty and captain of the men at arms in our good city; and<br>each profited during a longer or shorter space by her loving kindness, and her wise and faithful<br>counsel. many of them can likewise remember the late anna spiesz, sometime wife of herdegen schopper;<br>and as to the said herdegen schopper, my dear brother, margerys book of memorabila right truly<br>shows forth the manner of his life and mind in the bloom of his youth, and verily it is a sorrowful<br>task for me to set forth the decay and end of so noble a man. as to myself, the last remaining link of<br>the schopper chain whereof margery hath many times made mention, i am still with you, my dear ones;<br>and i remain but little changed, inasmuch as that my life has ever flowed calmly and silently onward.<br>how it came to pass that margery should so suddenly have brought her memories to an end most of<br>you know already; howbeit i will set it down for the younger ones. till she reached the age of sixty and<br>seven years, she never rode in a litter, but ever made her journeyings on horseback. for many years<br>past she and her husband abode in the forest during the summer months only, and dwelt in their town<br>fortunate; for, if they were at variance, he need not fear that they would act as firm allies against him<br>when he expressed the wish to have wolffs marriage solemnised as soon as circumstances would permit.<br>it was not yet time to discuss the matter with any one. he would first go to the jew pfefferkorn once<br>more to persuade him to defer his claims, and then, before the meeting of the council, would repair to<br>the ortliebs, to commit to herr ernst the destiny of the eysvogel firm and his partner wolff, on which<br>also depended the welfare of the young merchants betrothed bride. if the father remained obdurate, if he<br>resented the wrong he had inflicted yesterday upon him and his daughter, he was a lost man; for he<br>had already availed himself of the good will of all those whose doors usually stood open to him<br>doubtless the news of his recent severe losses were in every ones mouth, and the letter which he had just<br>received threatened him with an indictment. the luckless siebenburgs creditors, too, would now be added<br>to his own. it was all very well for him to say that he would settle his debts him self. as soon as it<br>was rumoured abroad that he had gambled away the estate of tannenreuth, whose value gave the<br>creditors some security, they would rise as one man, and the house assailed would be his, casper<br>eysvogels. the harried mans thoughts of his son in law were by no means the most kindly. meanwhile<br>the latter set out for the second distasteful interview of the morning. his purpose was to make some<br>arrangement with heinz schorlin about the lost estate and obtain definite knowledge concerning his<br>quarrel with him, of which he remembered nothing except that intoxication and jealousy had carried<br>him further than would have happened otherwise. he had undoubtedly spoken insultingly of els; his<br>words, when uttered against a lady, had been sharper than beseemed a knight. yet was not any one<br>who found a maiden alone at night with this man justified in doubting her virtue in the depths of his<br>soul he believed in her innocence, yet he avoided confessing it. why should not the swiss, whom nature<br>howbeit, when most of our quests had gone into the refectory, where the morning meal was by this time<br>steaming on the board, none were left with us save cousin maud and uncle conrad and uncle christian;<br>and uncle conrad enquired of the brunswicker whether he purposed indeed to set forth this day, and the<br>man answered no, if so be that his lordship the grand forester would grant him shelter yet awhile, and<br>consent to a plan to which he had been just now beguiled, and my uncle gave him his hand, and said<br>the longer he might stay the better, and then he went on to ask with some curiosity what that plan</P></BODY><END>
