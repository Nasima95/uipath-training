<P>godly knight, he would fight for her sake in honour of the gracious virgin, his face brightened. during<br>biberlis scoffing comments he had felt as if a tempest had hurled her pure image in the dust. but now<br>that he knew what she asked of him, it returned as a matter of course to its old place and, with a sigh<br>of relief, he felt that he need not be ashamed of the emotions which this wonderful young creature had<br>awakened in his soul. she had opened her pious heart like a trusting sister to an older brother, and<br>what he had seen there was something unusual things which had appeared scared to him even when a<br>child, since he took leave of her in the ball room he had felt as though heaven had loaned this, its<br>darling, to earth for but a brief space, and her brocade robe must conceal angel wings. should it<br>surprise him that the pure innocence which filled her whole being was expressed also in her letter, if<br>she summoned him, not to idle love dalliance but to a covenant of souls, a mutual conflict for what was<br>highest and most sacred such a thing was incomprehensible to biberli; but notwithstanding her letter<br>nay, even on its account he longed still more ardently to lead her home to his mother and see her<br>receive the blessing of the woman whom he so deeply honoured. he had evas letter read for the second<br>and the third time. but when biberli paused, and in a few brief sentences cast fresh doubts upon the<br>writer, heinz angrily stopped him. the longing of the godly heart of a pure maiden mark this well has<br>naught in common with that diabolical delight in secret love dalliance for which others yearn my wish<br>to force my way to her was sinful, and it was punished severely enough, for during your rude scoffs i<br>felt as though you had set fire to the house over my head, but from this i perceive in what a sacred,<br>inviolable spot her image had found a palce. true, it is denied you to follow the lofty, heavenward<br>incensed by the base interpretation which the servant placed upon evas going out into the street and,<br>terrified by the danger into which the knight threatened to plunge them all, she forgot the patience<br>and submission she was accustomed to show the true and steadfast biberlbut resolved to protect her<br>young mistress from the presumptuous knight scarcely had she angrily cried shame upon her lover for<br>this base suspicion, protesting that eva had never gone to seek a knight but, as she had often done on<br>bright moonlight nights, walked in her sleep down the stairs and out of doors, when the young girls<br>shriek of terror summoned her to her aid. biberli looked after her sullenly, meanwhile execrating<br>bitterly enough the wild love which had robbed his master of reason and threatened to hurl him,<br>biberli, and even the innocent katterle, whose brave defence of her mistress had especially pleased him,<br>into serious misfortune. when old endres appeared he had slipped behind a wall formed of bales heaped<br>one above another, and did not stir until the entry was quiet again. to his amazement he had then<br>found his master standing beside the door of the house, but his question which, it is true, was not<br>wholly devoid of a shade of sarcasm whether the knight was waiting for the return of his sleep walking<br>sweetheart, was so harshly rebuffed that he deemed it advisable to keep silence for a time. though<br>heinz schorlin had perceived that he had followed an unconscious somnambulist, he was not yet capable<br>of calmly reflecting upon what had occurred or of regarding the future with prudence. he knew one<br>thing only: the fear was idle that the lovely creature whose image, surrounded by a halo of light, still<br>hovered before him like a vision from from a higher, more beautiful world, was an unworthy person who,<br>with a face of angelic innocence, transgressed the laws of custom and modesty. her shriek of terror, her<br>horror at seeeing him, and the cry for help which had brought her sister to her aid and roused the<br>servants from their sleep, gave him the right to esteem her as highly as ever; and this conviction<br>fanned into such a blaze the feeling of happiness which love had awakened and his foolish distrust had<br>the pleasant grey eyes sparkled with the most genuine mirth, and she clapped her little hands so<br>joyously that the falcons chain on the gauntlet of her riding glove rattled and what was this no one<br>looks at a person whom one desires to wound with an expression of such cheerful encouragement as the<br>look with which cordula now gazed at els and heinz schorlin, who stood by her side. true, they were at<br>first extremely perplexed by the words she now shouted to those around her in a tone of loud<br>exultation, as though announcing a victory; but from the beginning they felt that there was no evil</P></BODY><END>
