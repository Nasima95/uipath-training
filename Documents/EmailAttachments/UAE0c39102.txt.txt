<P>take the color out of her own locks, it was the same with her velvet skin, which even at nuremberg had<br>many a time brought to mens minds the maid in the tale of snow white and rose red. thus it fell that<br> anselmo guistiniani had heard of her during the lifetime of his cousin the marchesa zorzi, while he was<br> absent from venice on state matters. and when he beheld her with his own eyes among the mourners,<br>there was an end to his peace of heart; he forthwith set himself to win her for his own. howbeit ursula<br>met her noble suitor with icy coldness, and when he and herdegen came together at the palazzo polani,<br>where she was lodging, she made as though she saw my lord not at all, and had no eyes nor ears save<br>for my brother; till it was more than guistinani would bear, and he abruptly departed. herdegens letter,<br>which told us all these things, was full of kindly pity for the fair and hapless damsel who had<br>demeaned herself basely towards him, by reason that her fiery love had turned her brain, and that<br>she still was pining for him to whom she had ever been faithful from her childhood up. she had freely<br>confessed as much even under the very eyes of so lordly a suitor as anselmo giustiniani; and albeit ann<br>might be sure of his constancy, even in despite of ursula, yet would he not deny that he could forgive<br>ursula much in that she had loved much, as the scripture saith, every shadow of danger for him was<br>gone and overpast; he had already bid ursula farewell, and was to ride forth next morning to genoa,<br>leaving the plague stricken city behind him, and would take ship there. it was well indeed that he<br>should be departing, inasmuch as yestereve, when he bid ursula good night, giustiniani had given him<br>to understand that he, herdegen, was in his way; at home he would have shown his teeth, and with<br>good right, to any man who had dared to speak to him, but in venice every man who lodged in the<br>fondaco was forbid the use of weapons, and he had heard tell of anselmo giustiniani that he, unlike the<br>after the true and steadfast fellow left her, her heart throbbed more and more anxiously, for the wrong<br>she had done in acting as messenger between the young daughter of her employers and a stranger<br>knight was indeed hard to forgive. instead of waiting in the kitchen or entry for her lovers return, as<br>she had intended, she had gone to the image of the virgin at the gate of the convent of st. clare, before<br>which she had often found consolation, especially when homesick yearning for the mountains of her<br>native switzerland pressed upon her too sorely. this time also it had been gracious to her, for after she<br>had prayed very devoutly and vowed to give a candle to the mother of god, as as well as to st. clare, she<br>fancied that the image smiled upon her and promised that she should go unpunished. on her return the<br>knight had just followed eva into the house, and biberli pursued his master as far as the stairs. here<br>katterle met her lover, but, when she learned what was occurring, she became greatly enraged and<br>incensed by the base interpretation which the servant placed upon evas going out into the street and,<br>terrified by the danger into which the knight threatened to plunge them all, she forgot the patience<br>and submission she was accustomed to show the true and steadfast biberli. but resolved to protect her<br>young mistress from the presumptuous knight scarcely had she angrily cried shame upon her lover for<br>this base suspicion, protesting that eva had never gone to seek a knight but, as she had often done on<br> bright moonlight nights, walked in her sleep down the stairs and out of doors, when the young girls<br>shriek of terror summoned her to her aid. biberli looked after her sullenly, meanwhile execrating<br>bitterly enough the wild love which had robbed his master of reason and threatened to hurl him,<br>biberli, and even the innocent katterle, whose brave defence of her mistress had especially pleased him<br>into serious misfortune. when old endres appeared he had slipped behind a wall formed of bales heaped<br>hand; there is nought so dear to them in especial to fleischmann as politics, and they are overjoyed if<br>they may but be sent on some embassy. aye, and they have done me some service, Ð°s a merchant<br>trader, whensoever i have desired the safe conduct of princes and knights; but as to charging them with<br>the safe conduct of my soul, the weal or woe of my immortal spirit no, no, never aye, margery, for i<br>have been a great sinner. greater power and more mighty mediation are needed to save and deliver me,<br>and behold, my margery, meseems hear me margery meseems a special ruling of heaven hath sent.<br>when is it that his eminence cardinal bernhardi will return from england hereupon i saw plainly what</P></BODY><END>
