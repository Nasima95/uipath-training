<P>to see one we love suffer. i had an only child; she was the joy of my heart. death death snatched her<br>from me, and a few days later the sovereign whom you, serve commanded us to prepare a feast for him<br>it seemed to him something new and delightful to hold a revel in a house of mourning, at the last<br> moment all the guests were assembled he sent us word that he himself did not intend to appear. but his<br>friends laughed and reveled wildly enough they enjoyed themselves, and no doubt praised our cook and<br>our wine, and now another honor we can duly appreciate he sends his praetorians to turn this house of<br>mourning into a tavern, a wine shop, where they call creatures in from the street to dance and sing.<br>the rank to which you have risen while yet so young shows that you are of good family, so you can<br>imagine how highly we esteem the honor of seeing your men trampling, destroying, and burning in<br>their camp fires everything which years of labar and care had produced to make our little garden a<br>thing of beauty. only look down on them macrinus, who commands you, promised me, moreover, that<br>the womens apartments should be respected. no praetarian, whether common soldier or commander, and<br>here she raised her voice, shall set foot within them here is his writing. the prefect set the seal beneath<br>it in caesars name, i know of the order, noble lady, interrupted nemesianus, and should be the last to<br>wish to act against it. i do not demand, i only appeal humbly to the heart of a woman and a mother.<br>a mother broke in berenike, scornfully; yes and one whose soul your lord has pierced with daggers a<br>woman whose home has been dishonored and made hateful to her. i have enjoyed sufficient honor now,<br>and shall stand firmly on my rights. hear but one thing more, began the youth, timidly; but the lady<br>berenike had already turned her back upon him, and returned with a proud and stately carriage to<br>melissa in the adjoining apartment. breathind hard, as if stunned by her words, the tribune remained<br>children would ever rack your brains over the italian poets rather than over matters of mine and thine,<br>albeit that is the axis on which the world turns. there would, in truth, be no justice in so vast a sum,<br>but that in the markets of egypt they reckon in venice sequins with none but the franks; nigh upon<br>thirteen of their dirhems go to the gold sequin, and thus we have let me reckon the old trader has not<br>forgotten his skill on his sick bed we have one thousand eight hundred and forty and six sequins; and<br>that is a vast ransom still such as is never paid but for lords of the highest degree. four and twenty<br>thousand sequins and again he laughed aloud. it is easily spoken, children, but you cannot even guess<br>what it would mean. believe me when i tell you that many a well to do merchant in nuremberg, who is<br>at the head of a fine trade, would be at his wits end if he were desired to pay down half of your four<br>and twenty thousand sequins in hard coin then i took up my parable and told him how eppelein had<br>stamped the sum on his mind, and that he for certain was in the right, both as to the sum and as to<br>the venice sequins, forasmuch as that herdegen, to the end that might know it rightly, had told him<br>that they should be ducats such as he had three in a red stuff wrapper, and kunz and i likewise each<br>two, in our money boxes as christening gifts. now while i thus spoke the old man was sorely troubled,<br>and his wax white face turned paler at each word. he raised himself up, leaning on the arms of the<br>great chair, so high that we were filled with amazement, and he gazed about him with his glassy eyes<br>and then said, still holding himself up: that, that. and yesterday, only yesterday. the captive himself.<br>four and twenty thousand sequins, do you say and i oh, what were my words but what old im hoff<br>promises that he will do. and yet. if you maids had but been duteous children, if you had but come to<br>me first, Ð°s trustful daugters. only yesterday i might yes, perchance i might. and then he stormed<br>there is one comfort, at any rate; even as praetor he has not forgotten his birds, and he will find<br>feathered friends go where he may. but i and it is for my sake that he must hide like a criminal but<br>here alexander vehemently broke in: it was not you, it was i who brought all this misery on us and he<br>went on to accuse himself so bitterly that melissa regretted having alluded to the misfortunes of their<br>family, and did her best to inspire him with courage. as soon as caesar should have left the city and<br>she had evaded his pursuit, the citizens would be easily persuaded of his innocence, they would see then<br>how little she had cared for the splendor and wealth of empire; why, he himself knew how quickly </P></BODY><END>
